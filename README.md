# [1. IMDB Movies](https://github.com/anks1312/Ankur_Portfolio/tree/main/IMDB_Movies)
I have used the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this, I found some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.
# [2. Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services using EDA](https://github.com/anks1312/Ankur_Portfolio/tree/main/Finance_EDA)
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter.

This analysis aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. 
# [3. Prediction of Demand for shared bikes using Linear regression](https://github.com/anks1312/Ankur_Portfolio/tree/main/Bike_Rental_Linear_Regression)
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. Lets say that the company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

I have built a linear regression model for the following findings:
	• Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
